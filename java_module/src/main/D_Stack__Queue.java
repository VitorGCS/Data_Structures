    Built on top of arrays with a few additional features:

    -> Stack: last in (.push(1)) - first out (.pop())
        Typical algorithms: DFS depth-first search

    -> Queue: First in (.enqueue(1)) - First out (.dequeue())
        Typical algorithms: BFS breadth-first search

    - efficient add and remove

    => negative points:
    - limited use cases compared to other data structures
